# Who is James?

James is your butler. As already stated, this Client is inspired by Knuddels, and 
James is the butler of Knuddels, and I really liked the idea of having a butler on 
the side of every user.
The interesting part here is: Only you can see him, and he will always be on your side.

When users are joining, he will greet them - These Messages are only visible to you.

Also: More to come.

# What's planned for 1.0?

- Full capability of the IRC protocol
- Customizable themes
- Chat-Games integration through James
